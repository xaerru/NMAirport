The Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), a large-scale infrastructure project that is set to become one of the busiest airports in India, 
is a key development for the regionâ€™s economy and its role in global aviation. 
As the airport's construction continues, there is an increasing need to address the complex operational challenges that arise from managing a modern airport. 
With air travel becoming more frequent and interconnected, airports need sophisticated systems to streamline operations, ensure safety, and provide a seamless experience for passengers. 
It was this growing need for efficiency, accuracy, and real-time data integration that motivated our team to develop the Airport Management System (AMS).
